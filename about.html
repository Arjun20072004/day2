    <h1>The History of Computers</h1>
    <h2><a href="index.html">Back to Home</a></h2>

    <h2>Early Computing Devices</h2>
    <p>The history of computers began with ancient calculating devices like the abacus (around 2700-2300 BC) and the Antikythera mechanism from ancient Greece.</p>

    <h2>Mechanical Era</h2>
    <p>In the 17th century, Blaise Pascal invented the Pascaline, an early mechanical calculator. Charles Babbage designed the Analytical Engine in the 1830s, considered the first general-purpose computer concept.</p>

    <h2>Electronic Computers</h2>
    <p>The ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), built in 1946, was the first general-purpose electronic computer. It used vacuum tubes and weighed about 30 tons.</p>

    <h2>Modern Era</h2>
    <p>The invention of the transistor in 1947 revolutionized computing. Personal computers emerged in the 1970s-1980s with the Apple II, Commodore 64, and IBM PC. The internet era began in the 1990s, followed by mobile computing and cloud technology.</p>

    <h2>Contemporary Computing</h2>
    <p>Today, computers are ubiquitous in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and advanced data processing, fundamentally transforming society and technology.</p>
